# Instructions

• Download playcurl.zip [HERE](https://github.com/daboynb/PlayIntegrityNEXT/releases/download/playcurl/playcurl.zip) and play integrity fix module (by chiteroman) [HERE](https://github.com/chiteroman/PlayIntegrityFix/releases/latest)

 Flash both modules and reboot your device.

• Open the FP Downloader app and grant the necessary permissions. Alternatively, if you've chosen the Termux method, run the 'fp' command.

• Use the SPIC app to verify Play Integrity or the Play Store Checker.

Note: If you've chosen the FP Manual app or no app, when the FP is banned, you will need to open it or use the Termux command "fp".

# Binaries

        - fp -> Downloads a working FP and fixes errors in the setup.
        - fpd -> Runs the 'fp' command and then disables all other modules to test incompatibility.
        - fpa -> Runs the 'fp' command and then checks for device integrity; if not met, it runs the 'fpd' command.
        - fpt -> Checks multiple JSON files.

# Instructions for fpt

        - Put all your JSON files into /storage/emulated/0/pif_to_test.
        - Open Termux.
        - Type 'su' and then 'fpt'. All the good JSON files will be moved to /storage/emulated/0/pif_ok.
